## About
Requirements capture in large financial regulatory and compliance documents is a strenuous, time consuming, and a costly task. The current approach to regulatory compliance by the financial services industry is manual and labor intensive which makes the whole process costly in terms of time and money. Additionally, there arenâ€™t enough people that qualify to be compliance professionals. In wake of ever increasing volume of data and an increase in expectations of compliance responsibilities, it is essential to streamline this task by reducing the amount of work significantly. This project proposes an approach to achieve that goal by applying Natural Language Processing and Text Mining to extract requirements and their concepts (RDF triples). Furthermore, this project outlines a comprehensive way to get human input to determine the authenticity of the requirements and then to display the findings in an executive dashboard
